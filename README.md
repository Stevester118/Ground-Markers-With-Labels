# Ground Markers With Labels
This plugin allows you to add labels when you mark a tile. These labels appear on top of the marked tile so you know what each tile represents.

The entire plugin is just the original RuneLite tile marker plugin with label functionality added.

The original RuneLite tile marker plugin **must be disabled** before attempting to mark a tile with this plugin.

To enable the label feature, navigate to Runelite Config Menu  -> Ground Marker With Labels plugin -> Check 'Draw Text Label on Tile' checkbox

The original functionality of pressing shift + right click to mark a tile is present.

If working properly, a chat box field will open for the user to enter their label name after selecting a tile to mark. Simply press enter when finished to create the tile.

Credits to Reasel for developing the original code used for the label functionality.
